**Neverball controlled with a Wii Balance Board.**  
Your body *is* the controller.

`neverball-fit` maps real-time weight shifts from a **Wii Balance Board**
to tilt controls in **Neverball** on Linux.

This is not a mod.
This is not an emulator.
This is pure input mapping madness.

## 🎮 Concept

Neverball usually tilts the world using keyboard or mouse input.

In this project:

- Lean forward → tilt forward
- Lean backward → tilt backward
- Lean left / right → tilt sideways
- Optional stomp → action input

Your center of mass becomes the joystick.

## 🧠 Why?

Because:
- keyboards are boring
- physics should be personal
- doom-fit proved this is possible

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

You will fall.
Neverball will laugh.
Linux will survive.
