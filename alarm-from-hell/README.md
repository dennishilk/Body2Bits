# Alarm from Hell 😈

An alarm clock that enforces wakefulness through physics.

This alarm will NOT stop when you press a button.
It stops only if your body proves that you are awake.

## How it works

- Alarm starts ringing
- You must step onto a Wii Balance Board
- Perform a defined number of squats or stomps
- Remain still for a short period
- Leaving the board resets or escalates the alarm

## Why?

Because snoozing is a lie we tell ourselves.

## Status

Experimental.  
Designed to be unpleasant, effective, and funny to watch.

## Part of

**Body2Bits** – Human body as a game controller.
