# DoomFit

**Play Doom with your body.**

DoomFit is an experimental input project that replaces
keyboard and mouse controls with a Wii Balance Board.

Your body weight, balance, and movement are translated
directly into in-game actions.

This is not a fitness game.
This is Doom.
The pain is optional.

## How it works

- A Wii Balance Board connects via Bluetooth
- Raw sensor data is read on Linux
- Weight shifts and stomps are detected
- Inputs are mapped to keyboard events
- Doom becomes a full-body experience

Forward, backward, turning, and actions
are controlled entirely by physical movement.

## Why Doom?

Because Doom is simple, deterministic, and unforgiving.
If input mapping fails, you immediately feel it.

That makes Doom an excellent test environment
for experimental human-body input systems.

## What this project is (and isn’t)

**It is:**
- a hardware input experiment
- a Linux sensor playground
- a ridiculous but functional controller

**It is not:**
- a fitness product
- a medical device
- an ergonomic recommendation

## Status

Working.
Unstable.
Surprisingly effective.

Part of **Body2Bits**.
